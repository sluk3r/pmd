**PMD** is a source code analyzer. It finds common programming flaws like unused variables, empty catch blocks,
unnecessary object creation, and so forth. It supports many languages. It can be extended with custom rules.
It uses JavaCC and Antlr to parse source files into abstract syntax trees (AST) and runs rules against them to find violations.
Rules can be written in Java or using a XPath query.

It supports Java, JavaScript, Salesforce.com Apex and Visualforce,
Modelica, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, XML, XSL.
Scala is supported, but there are currently no Scala rules available.

Additionally it includes **CPD**, the copy-paste-detector. CPD finds duplicated code in
C/C++, C#, Dart, Fortran, Go, Groovy, Java, JavaScript, JSP, Kotlin, Lua, Matlab, Modelica,
Objective-C, Perl, PHP, PLSQL, Python, Ruby, Salesforce.com Apex, Scala, Swift, Visualforce and XML.

In the future we hope to add support for data/control flow analysis and automatic (quick) fixes where
it makes sense.

## üöÄ Installation and Usage

Download the latest binary zip from the [releases](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/releases/latest)

**Demo:**

This shows how PMD can detect for loops, that can be replaced by for-each loops.
